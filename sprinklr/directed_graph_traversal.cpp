// There are N nodes. Each node has exactly 1 directed edge. You have to return the node from which maximum elements can be traversed.
// For eg : N=3 and A[]={3,3,1}
// So there is a directed edge from node 1 to node 3, from node 2 to node 3 and from node 3 to node 1;
// So if we start from node 2 we can traverse all the elements.
// Output : Return 2
